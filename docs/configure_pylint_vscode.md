# Suppress warning

Suppress warnings if they are inappropriate so that other issues are not hidden. To suppress warnings, you can set a line-level comment:
```python
def do_PUT(self):  # WSGI name, so pylint: disable=invalid-name
  ...
  
for i in range(len(nums)):  # pylint: disable=C0200

for i in range(len(nums)):  # pylint: disable=consider-using-enumerate
```


# Configure Pylint
## Step 1: Install Pylint in VS Code

```
pip install pylint
```
Or system-wide:
```
sudo apt -y install enchant-2
sudo apt -y install pylint
```

Install the Python extension for VS Code: Search for "Python" by Microsoft

## Step 2: Generate a .pylintrc File

To create a `.pylintrc` file with default configurations:

Open the VS Code terminal.
Run:
```
pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
```

This command will create a .pylintrc file in the root directory of your project.

Or create `.pylintrc` manually in the project root.

## Step 3: Configure VS Code to Use .pylintrc

Open VS Code Settings:
    Press Ctrl + , or go to File > Preferences > Settings.

In the search bar, type "pylint args" to locate the setting.

Click on "Edit in settings.json" to add custom configurations.

Add the following configuration to your settings.json file:


```
"python.linting.pylintArgs": ["--rcfile=.pylintrc"]
```


This tells VS Code to use your .pylintrc file for linting.


## Step 4: Enable Pylint as the Default Linter

Make sure Pylint is set as the default linter in VS Code.

In Settings (Ctrl + ,), search for "linter".

Ensure the following setting is enabled in your settings.json:

```
"python.linting.enabled": true,
"python.linting.pylintEnabled": true
```

## Step 5: Customizing the .pylintrc File

You can customize your .pylintrc file according to your projectâ€™s requirements. Here are some common settings:

 Disabling specific warnings:
```
[MESSAGES CONTROL]
disable=consider-using-enumerate
```


Setting maximum line length:
```
[FORMAT]
max-line-length=100
```

Ignoring specific files or folders:
```
[MASTER]
ignore=migrations,venv
```


## Example of a .pylintrc File

Here's a sample .pylintrc configuration:

```
[MASTER]
ignore=tests,venv
persistent=yes

[MESSAGES CONTROL]
disable=missing-docstring,invalid-name,too-few-public-methods,consider-using-enumerate

[FORMAT]
max-line-length=120
indent-string='    '

[BASIC]
good-names=i,j,k,ex,Run,_
variable-rgx=[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{2,30}$
const-rgx=([A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*)|(__.*__)

[TYPECHECK]
ignore-mixin-members=yes

[IMPORTS]
known-third-party=numpy,pandas,requests

```
